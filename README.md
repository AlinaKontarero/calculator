# Calculator 

Hi, 

Here is my solution for the Monster team. The calculator is also deployed on AWS S3 Bucket: [Monster Calculator](https://monster-calculator.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)

I would be more than happy to get your feedback and to meet the engineering team in person. 
Please find my [Linkedin here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-kontarero/)

Kind regards, 
Aline
